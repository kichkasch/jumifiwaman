		<strong>Introduction</strong> <br/>
JuMi Firmware Manager (JuMiFiWaMan) is a web-based tool allowing you to
comfortably manage the update management process of firmwares for your
(multimedia) devices (home).</p>

<p>Background is the steadily increasing dependence of up-to-date firmware of
such multimedia devices. In order to get around bugs (which came with the
shipped product) or to make use of latest features, the latest firmware needs
to be installed. As the number of devices grows, it becomes quite a task to
check for updates of firmware of all these devices on a frequent basis.</p>

<p>JuMiFiWaMan supports you exactly on this process. A database in the
background is holding information about many device (perspectively at least)
and firmware versions available for them. You only need to assemble your set
of device (by choosing from this repository) - and (again perspectively) you
get informed whenever new versions are released - be it on the web side or
via email notification service.

		<strong>My Devices</strong><br/>
This section enables you to assemble and manage your own set of devices. It
also provides an overview on current state of available and performed updates
as well as it supports reports on histories for updates.

		<strong>Device Manager</strong><br/>
With this section everybody can take care of an exhaustive set of devices
being covered with JuMiFiWaMan. All you need to provide is an unique id
number for each device and a name as well as the name of the manufacturer. On
top, a grouping of devices (e.g. all DVD-Players etc.) is supported.

    <p><strong>Firmware Manager</strong>
In this section the up-to-date information for new firmware releases is to be
maintained. In the beginning, this will exclusively be a community based
approach (manually check for updates and insert information) - later on
(semi) automatic agents shall take care of this update process.</p>
